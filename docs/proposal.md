# Catalyst Fund 14 Proposal – Erasmus Blockchain Club Network

## Category
Ecosystem – Community & Outreach

## Problem Statement
While there are growing numbers of university blockchain clubs across Europe, they often work in isolation. Erasmus exchange students create natural cross-border links, but there is no dedicated online infrastructure to connect these clubs for collaboration, resource sharing, and joint events.

Without a unifying network, many opportunities are lost to build larger, more impactful student-led Cardano communities.

## Proposed Solution
We will build and launch the **Erasmus Blockchain Club Network**, an online hub that:
- Lists active Cardano student clubs across EU universities.
- Hosts a shared event calendar for virtual and in-person activities.
- Provides a resource library with guides, presentations, and templates.
- Allows student leaders to communicate and plan joint initiatives.

The hub will be lightweight, open-source, and designed for easy adoption by any student club.

## Benefits & Impact
- Increases cross-border collaboration between clubs.
- Creates a permanent knowledge base for student-led Cardano initiatives.
- Encourages new clubs to form with ready-to-use materials.
- Positions Cardano as the blockchain of choice for student innovation.

## Budget Request – 36,500 ADA
| Item | Description | Cost (ADA) |
|------|-------------|------------|

- Upload all guides and templates.
- Host first joint online event.

**Month 4 – Growth & Wrap-Up**

## Open Source Commitment
Platform code under MIT License. Resources under Creative Commons.

## Team Roles
- Lead Proposer – Coordination & partnerships.
- Developer – Platform coding.
- Designer – UI/UX & branding.
- Community Manager – Outreach & moderation.

## Risks & Mitigation
- Low club participation → Provide strong incentives and ready-to-use content.
- Platform underuse → Focus on direct onboarding calls and initial event hosting.

## Distinction from Other Proposals
This project is online and infrastructure-focused, while **Cardano for Erasmus Students** is in-person awareness-focused.
